# Types of bricks
**Bricks can be classified in many types**

### Based on the quality of bricks.

##### 1. First class brick .
- Compressive strength: 105 kg/cm^2
- Water absorption capacity: 20%.
- Colour: Cherry red
- Corners and edges: corners and edges must be very sharp.
- By scratching with finger nail no mark should left on the brick.
- After hitting the brick with another same brick or hammer, it should produce metallic sound. 
- weight of this brick should be 3kg to 3.5kd.
- It's used in exterior work, to give strength to structure, it is used in the reinforcement work

#### 2. Second class bricks.
- Compressive strength: 75kg/cm^2
- Water absorption capacity: 22%
- Colour: Light cherry red.
- Corner and edges: Less sharp compared to the first class brick.
- It doesn't make metallic sound on hitting on other brick.
- It is used in hidden structure. 

#### 3. Third class bricks.
- Compressive strength: 35kg/cm^2
- Water absorption capacity: 25%
- Colour: Yellow.
- Corner: not sharp
- By scratching with finger nail it will leave mark on the surface of the brick.
- It produce dull sound when hit by other brick.
- It is used in non-load bearing wall. Like boundary walls.

### Based on the strength of brick

- Is code 3102 divided bricks according to their strength. 
- The least compressive strength of the brick should be 35kg/cm^2 (bricks below the compressive strength of 35kg/cm^2 shouldn't be used in engineering work.)

### Based on burning of bricks.

**Based on burning bricks are divided in the following parts**

#### 1. Under burnt brick (Pale brick)
- It is yellow in colour.
- It is very soft.
- Very less strength.
- These bricks shouldn't be exposed to rain water.
- It is used in soiling under RCC footing or basement.

#### 2. Perfectly burnt brick or burnt brick (Body brick)
- These are the best quality bricks.
- First, second, third class bricks comes under this category. 

#### 3. Overburnt brick or Jhama brick (Arch brick)
- They are burned more than normal brick so their shape gets distorted.
- Compressive strength of this brick is very high: 300kg/cm^2
- Water absorption capacity is very low: 10%
- Colour: Blackish
- Due to the irregular shape it is used as brick ballast in the foundation.

### Based on the holes in the brick 

#### 1. Small hole and large hole Bricks

If the size of the holes is less than 20mm and surface area of holes is less than 500mm^2 that it's called small hole bricks. Otherwise It is called large hole bricks.

#### 2. Solid Bricks.

If the volumes of the holes is less than 20% of the brick volume than the brick is called solid brick. 

#### 3. Hollow Brick 

If the volume of holes is more than 20% to the volume of the brick than it's know as hollow brick. 

#### 4. Perforated Brick

When the volume of small holes is more than 25% to the volume of the bricks is known as perforated brick. 

### Based on the use

#### 1. Common Brick

- It is used in common works.
- Accroding to IS:3102 the compressive strength of the brick shouldn't be less than 35kg/cm^2
- They are usually used in interior walls. 

#### 2. Facing Brick

- This brick is used in the facing work, suck as outer walls for better aesthetics.
- It is used to protect from  the environment effects.
- They are stronger and durable than the normal bricks. 
- They are red, and brown in colour. 

#### 3. Engineering Brick

- They have high compressive strngth and low absorption capacity.
- They have good load bearing qualities and chemical resistance and damp proof. 
- They are uniform red in colour.
- They are divided into three categories. Class A, Class B, Class C. Class A is the strongest and Class B is most used. 
- They are used in sewers, manholes, damp proofing courses etc. 

### Special forms of bricks

#### King closer

_King closer_

When the corner of the brick is cut at the half of it's length (l/2) and half of the breadth (b/2) then that brick is known as king closer.

These bricks are used in [jambs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jamb) of doors and windows.

#### Queen closer

_Queen closer_

When the brick is cut equally in two parts in the direction of the length.

Queen closer are used in [english bond](https://www.theconstructioncivil.org/english-bond-brick-masonry/)

#### Bat

_ Different kind Bat_ 

Bat is when the brick is cut acroos its width

- If the brick is cut in half then it's known as half bat.
- If the brick is cut at 3/4 than it is know three-quarter-bat.
- If the brick is bvelled then it's known as bevelled bat.
- 3/4 bat is used in [flemish bond](https://www.theconstructioncivil.org/flemish-bond-brick-masonry/)
- 1/2 and 3/4 bats are used in [english bond](https://www.theconstructioncivil.org/english-bond-brick-masonry/)

#### Coping Brick

_Coping Brick_

This brick is used for the coping of parapet.

#### Bevelled Brick

_Beveled Brick_

- When the brick is cut from the corner of the length and middle of the width known as beveled closer.
- It is used for the angles less than 90 deg. 

#### BUllnose brick

_Bullnose Brick_

- This brick looks like bull nose.
- To make the sharp edges of the wal rounded.
- It's used in draining work. 

#### Cant brick

_Double cant brick_

- When one corner of the brick is cut it is known as single cant brick.
- If two corners are cut from the brick it is known as double cant brick.
- It is used in jambs and to give different angles in the wall. 

#### Squint brick.

_squint brick_

- When the one corner is cut at the 45 deg of its width and another cornder is also cut it's known as squint brick. 
- It is used in exterior angle and interior angles.


#### Refactory brick / fire resistant brick

- This brick is used to bear extreme temperature. 
- This brick is burnt at 1700 deg c to 1800 deg c.
- This brick is used in compressive chamber.
- Lining of chimney and furnance, floors of factories. 

## **NOTES** 

- To make sound proof and heat proof wall we use Hollow brick. 
- **Soling**: A layer of dry brick put below the foundation concrete in the case of soft soil.
- **Dressing**: Process of removing of impurities of clay using iron ores.
- **Metre square wall**: Usually wall is measured in m^3 but when the brick wall is measured in metere square it is known as metere square wall or partition wall. Its thickness is 10cm
