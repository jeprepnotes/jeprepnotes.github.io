_efflorescence_

- Efflorescence happens due to the alkalis (salts).
- When bricks comes in the contact of moisture, water gets absorbed and alkali crystalizes and forms white patches. 
- Efflorescence can be minimized by using proper clay and coating bricsk so it doesn't absorb mositure. 

## 2. Cracks/ Checks

- When cracks comes in the bricks parallel to the short side of the bricks. 
- It happen because of the lump lime. When brick absorb water it expands and cracks form on its surface. 
- It also happens because of excess water in the brick. 

## 3. Chuffs

When the rain water falls over a hot brick and the brick deforms it is knows as chuffs.

## 4. Black core defect

When the carbonaceous materials are present in the brick eartch it won't fully oxidise and the core of the brick becomes black. 

## 5. Bloating

When the extra spongy swollen mass collects over the brick it is known as bloating. It happens because of the sulphur and carbonaceous materials.

## 6. Spalling

When the surface of the brick flakes off. It happens because of the water heating inside the brick. 

## 7. Lamination

When the air is present in the voids of the brick  a thin layer of lamina forms on the surface of the brick. Known as lamination.
