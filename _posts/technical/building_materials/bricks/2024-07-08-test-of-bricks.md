# Tests of Bricks

## 1. Dimension test

_Dimension Test_

- Brick shrinks almost 10% of its size
- In this test we randomly pick 20 bricks.
- Then put them in longitudnal direction and measure the length.
- If the totol length is 380 ± 8 then it's considered good brick. 
- And then brick is kept in the direction of the width.
- If the total width is 180 ± 4 then it's considered right brick. 
- According to IS 2% diffence is permissible in average size of the brick. 

## 2. Compressive strength test

_compressive test_

- We take 3 to 6 random bricks for sample.
- Then keep it under water for 24 hours. 
- After that brick is kept in the compression machine and 140kg/cm^2/min compressive load is applied in the brick.
- Measure the value at which brick break. 

$$
\begin{equation}
compressive strength = Maximum load at failure / Area of specimen
\end{equation}
$$

| Brick | value|
|:--:|:--:|
|1st class brick| 105 kg/cm^2|
|2nd class brick| 75 kg/cm^2|
|3rd class brick| 35 kg/cm^2|

## 3. Water absorption test

- In this we take 5 bricks for sample.
- Measure dry weight of the bricks (w1).
- Then brick is kept under water for 24 hours. 
- Brick weight is again measured (w2).
- And the absorption capacity is measured.

$$
\begin{equation}
absorption capacity = (w2 - w1 / w1) * 100
\end{equation}
$$

- It is measured in percentage. 

| Brick | value|
|:--:|:--:|
|1st class brick| 20%|
|2nd class brick| 22%|
|3rd class brick| 25%|

## 4. Efflorescence test

- In this brick is immersed under water for 24 hours and then brick is dried. 
- The amount Efflorescence is measured in the brick. 
- If the white deposit is 0 then it is called **nil**.
- If the white deposit is 0 to 10% than it is known as **light efflorescence**.
- if the white deposit is 10 to 50% than it is known as **Moderate efflorescence**.
- If the white deposit is more than 50% than it is known as **Heavey efflorescence**.

## 5. Warpose test

In this test 10 brick is taken for sample and then checked if their surface is plain or not.
