# Brick

***A brick is a type of construction material used to build walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Properly, the term brick denotes a unit primarily composed of clay, but is now also used informally to denote units made of other materials or other chemically cured construction blocks. Bricks can be joined using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking. Bricks are usually produced at brickworks in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region, and are produced in bulk quantities*** [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Brick)


## Size of brick 
* **Standard Size**: 19x9x9 cm.
* **Modular size**: ***same as standard size*** 19x9x9 cm.
* **Nominal size**: (***It is the size of brick with mortor***) 20x10x10 cm.
* **Traditional/ Conventinal size of brick**: 9x4.5x3 inches.

## Weight of brick. 
* Weight of brick: **3 kg to 3.5 kg**

## Ingredients of brick earth 
***It the ingredients of soil by which brick is made. The trick to remmember it is `SALIMA`***
* **Silica** -> 50% to 60%.
* **Alumina** -> 20% to 30%.
* **Lime** -> 4% to 5%.
* **Iron Oxide** -> 5% to 6%.
* **Magnesia** -> 1%.
* **Alkalies** -> 1%

**NOTE: The total amount of clay and silt should be less than 50%**

## Functions of ingredients of Brick earth 

### 1. [Silica](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Silicon_dioxide) (50% to 60%)

  * It provides **Strength** and **Durability** to the brick.
  * It reduces the **shrinkage** of the brick. 
  * It keeps the **edges** of the brick **sharp**.
  * It stops **warping**

  ***Excessive amount of silica _(over 50 to 60%)_ will make brick brittle and weak, due to the loss of cohession (cohession is the property of of some elemenet to form a bond)***

### 2. [Alumina](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aluminium_oxide) (20% to 30%) 

  * It provides **plasticity** to the brick.
  * It is the main component of the brick. 

  ***Excessive amount of Alumina _(over 20% to 30%)_ : The edges of the brick won't be sharp in the edges and corners. And the shrinkage will increase due to which cracks will be generated in the brick***

### 3. [Lime](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/lime_(material)) (4% to 5%)

  * The lime shouldn't be in **lump form**. It should be in **Powder form** always.
  * It reduces **shrinkage** in the brick.
  * It works as a **flux**.

  ***Excessive amount of Lime _(over 4% t0 5%)_ : It can over burn the brick.***

### 4. [Iron oxide](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iron_oxide) (5% to 6%)

  * It **provides** the **red colour** to the brick.
  * It make brick **impermeable**.
  * It gives **Hardness** to the brick.

  ***Excessive amount of Iron Oxide _(over 5% to 6%)_, It makes the brick blackish or dark blue***

### 5. [Magnesia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Magnesium_oxide) (1%)

  * It gives **yellow colour** to the brick.
  * It reduces **shrinkage** in the brick.

  ***Excessive amount of Magnesia _(over 1%)_, makes the brick yellwish and the decay of the brick will start***

### 6. [Alkalies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alkali) (1%)
  It shouldn't be present. It causes **[efflorosence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Efflorescence)**.


## Harmful substances in Brick earth. 
### 1. [Organic matter](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Organic_matter)
  * It includes things like _plants leaves and roots_ and while burning of brick the leave the gap.
  * It makes the moulding of the brick harder. 

### 2. [Lump lime](https://search.brave.com/search?q=lump+lime&source=desktop&summary=1&summary_og=046128ca81c523ada233ce)
 * When burning of the brick it will form **CaO (Calicium oxide)**. CaO reacts with **water (H2O)** and it volume increases 2 to 2.5 times which can cause **cracks** in the brick. 

### 3. [Alkalies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alkali)
 * The cause **efflorosence** in the brick.

### 4. Pebbles and gravels
 * Due to them proper mixing and moulding won't happen.

### 5. [Carbonaceous material](https://search.brave.com/search?q=carboneceous+material&source=web&summary=1&summary_og=696c047b5a5ba2ad2a2a95)
  * It cause **black core defect** in the brick.

### 6. [Sulphur](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sulfur)
  * In the presences of sulphur extra **spongy swollen mass** will collect on the surface of the brick.
