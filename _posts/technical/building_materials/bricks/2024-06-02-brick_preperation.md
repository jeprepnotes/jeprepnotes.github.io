# Preperation of Bricks

1. Preperation of Brick earth.
2. Moulding.
3. Drying.
4. Burning.

## 1. Preperation of brick earth
***Brick earth is a soil or clay that is used to make bricks***

**Clay is prepared to make bricks in the following steps:**

### 1.1. Unsoiling (removel of top layer of soil) 
  In this step the top layer of the soil is removed around 20 to 25 cm. It's important to remove the top layer because it contains a lot of **impurities** and **organic material**.

### 1.2. Digging 
  After removing the top layer of the soil the clean soil is dug up for manufacturing of brick.

### 1.3. Cleaning
  Soil will be cleaned after digging up. There will be a lot of stones and pebbles present in the soil, removel of those impurities is done in this step. In this step soil can become clumsy so it's important to break them in the powder.
### 1.4. Weathring 
  After cleaning the soil. The soil is left in the open atmosphere for few weeks. Because of it the quality of soil will imporve (it's plasticity and strength will improve). In large projects the lay will dug up before the mansoon and then allowed to weather for the whole monsoon.

### 1.5. Blending 
  To increase the quality of soil we add sandy and calcareous clays. And if some material is not available in the sufficient amount it's added in this step. 

### 1.6. Tempering
  In this step water is added in the soil in the sufficient amount and the soil is prepared for moulding.
  
  * If brick earth is made manually then it's called **Kneeding** (in this process worker kneed the soil under their feet to make stiff and homogenous).
  * If the large amount of brick is needed then **[pug mill](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pugmill)** is used and this process is known as **pugging**. 


## 2. Moulding 
Bricks are moulded with the help of mould, bricks are made in modular size **19 X 9 X 9** 

***Materials used for moulding are***

### 2.1. Moulds
  ***Moulds are of two types**
  
  1. Steel mould
  2. Wooden mould

  * Steel moulds are durable than wooden mould.
  * More bricks can be made using wooden mould compared to steel mould. 
  * The steel mould give better quality bricks. 
  * Dalborgia sissoo (rosewood / shisam) are used for woonden moulds.
  * Size of mould is **21 x 10 x 10**
    
    After the brick is burnt the brick shrinks 1/10 of its dimension (10% of it's size)

```
      the size of the brick is 19x9x9 cm 

      size of mould 21x10x10 cm 

      10% of 21 = 2,1 cm (it is considered 2)

      After shrinking the brick will be 21 - 2 = 19 cm

      10% of 10 = 1

      After shrinking the brick will be 10 - 1 = 9 cm
```

### 2.2. Stock Board

_Brick frog_

It is used to make frog in the brick. 

  **Frog**:
  * It is made in the top surface of the brick.
  * Bonding becomes good because of the frog.
  * Due to the frog capacity to bear shear force of the wall increases.
  * Trademan names are embeded in reverse/inverse direction 
  * **Size of frog 10 x 4 x ( 1 or 2) cm**

### 2.3. Strike
It is used to remove the extra soil from the top of the brick.

### 2.4 Pallet Board

_Pallet board_

It is used to dry bricks after moulding and transportation 
size of pallete: **40" x 48"**

### 2.5 Types of moulding 
***There are two kinds of molding***
#### 2.5.1 Hand Moulding:
 - In this method the bricks are moulded by hand. It is done where man power is cheap and readily available for the manufacturing of the bricks on the small scale. 
 - The moulds are rectuangular boxes open at the top and bottom they are made up of stell or wood. 
 - The typical steel mould is made up of steel angles and steel plate.
 - The thickness of the steel mould is 6mm 
***The bricks that are hand moulded are of two types***
  1. Ground Moulded 
  2. Table Moulded 

##### Ground Moulded bricks.
 - In this the mould is dipped in water and then placed in the ground. Some sand is sprinkled on the ground before placing the mould. And then the clay is put in the mould. Then the clay is pressed in the mould with pressure so it fills every corner of the mould and the extra layer of soil is removed from top of the brick using wooden or steel strike. Then the mould is lifted and the raw brick is left on the ground. 
 - Then the mould is placed just next to the brick and the same process repeats until the ground is covered with bricks. 
 - A brick moulder can mould around 750 bricks a day by working 8hrs a day. 
 - The brick prepared by dipping in water is known as **Slop Moulded brick** and when the fine sand and ash is rubbed inside the mould it is known as **Sand Moulded brick**.
 - The lower surface of the ground moulded brick is rough is not possible to frog it. 
 - The good quality ground moulded brick and brick with frog are made using **pallet board**. The mould is fixed on the **stock board** and then the same process happens and in the end the whole thing is turned upside putting the raw brick in the pallet board and taking the brick to the drying shed. 
 - The bricks are kept on the longer side to dry them. They take the less space and dry quicker and better. 

##### Table Moulded bricks.
 It is same as **Ground Moulding** just in this brick moulder stands near a table and all the things needed will be near him in the table the size of the table is **2m x 1m**.  The efficiency in this method decreases because the moulder has to stand in just one place for work. And the cost also increases in this method. 

#### Machine moulding
***Machine moulding gives better brick. It is economical when there is large scale brick production and it can mould hard and strong clay.***

These Machines are classified in two categories

##### Plastic clay machine 
  - Such machines have opening equal to the size of brick. 
  - The pugged clay is placed in the machine. And the bricks are come out the opening. 
  - It is cut by wires fixed in the frame.
  - These bricks are also known as wire cut bricks. 

##### Dry clay Machines
  - This machine is used for hard clay.
  - Hard clay is broken in the powder form and a little amount of water is added and placed over a mould.
  - Then the machine pressed the clay hard to make a hard and well-shaped brick. 
  - Such brick doesn't need drying and they can be sent directly to the burner. 
  - They are also called pressed bricks. 

    ***The wire cut and the pressed bricks have sharp edges and corners and they are well-shaped. They are heavier and stronger than the hand moulded bricks.***


## 3. Drying

***Drying is done in the natural envrionment by keeping the moulded bricks in the environment but not under direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause cracks in the brick***

- Usually bricks are dried for 3 to 9 days.
- It is dried in the open air and not under direct sunlight. 
- 3% to 4% water content will be there in the brick after drying process. 
- After drying the process the brick is know as sundry brick.
- compressive strength of sundry brick is 21 kg/cm^2.

## 4. Burning 
### 4.1 Temp
  - Ecact temp: **1100 deg C**
  - Range: **900 c to 1200 C**

### 4.2 Underburnt & Overburnt brick
  - Overburnt brick are brittle, weak (they easily break)
  - Underburnt brick will be soft and will fail to bear load
