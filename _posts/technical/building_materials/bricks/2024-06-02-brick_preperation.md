# Preperation of Bricks

1. Preperation of Brick earth.
2. Moulding.
3. Drying.
4. Burning.

## 1. Preperation of brick earth
***Brick earth is a soil or clay that is used to make bricks***

**Clay is prepared to make bricks in the following steps:**

### 1.1. Unsoiling (removel of top layer of soil) 
  In this step the top layer of the soil is removed around 20 to 25 cm. It's important to remove the top layer because it contains a lot of **impurities** and **organic material**.

### 1.2. Digging 
  After removing the top layer of the soil the clean soil is dug up for manufacturing of brick.

### 1.3. Cleaning
  Soil will be cleaned after digging up. There will be a lot of stones and pebbles present in the soil, removel those impurities is done in this step. In this step soil can become clumsy so it's important to break them in the powder.
### 1.4. Weathring 
  After cleaning the soil. The soil is left in the open atmosphere for few weeks. Because of it the quality of soil will imporve (it's plasticity and strength will improve).

### 1.5. Blending 
  To increase the quality of soil we add sandy and calcareous clays. And if some material is not available in the sufficient amount it's added in this step. 

### 1.6. Tempering
  In this step water is added in the soil in the sufficient amount and the soil is prepared for moulding.
  
  * If brick earth is made manually then it's called **Kneeding** (in this process worker kneed the soil under their feet to make stiff and homogenous).
  * If the large amount of brick is needed then **[pug mill](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pugmill)** is used and this process is known as **pugging**. 


## 2. Moulding 
Bricks are moulded with the help of mould, bricks are made in modular size **19 X 9 X 9** 

***Materials used for moulding are***

### 2.1. Moulds
  ***Moulds are of two types**
  
  1. Steel mould
  2. Wooden mould

  * Steel moulds are durable than wooden mould.
  * More bricks can be made using wooden mould compared to steel mould. 
  * The steel mould give better quality bricks. 
  * Dalborgia sissoo (rosewood / shisam) are used for woonden moulds.
  * Size of mould is **21 x 10 x 10**
    
    After the brick is burnt the brick shrinks 1/10 of its dimension (10% of it's size)

```
      the size of the brick is 19x9x9 cm 

      size of mould 21x10x10 cm 

      10% of 21 = 2,1 cm (it is considered 2)

      After shrinking the brick will be 21 - 2 = 19 cm

      10% of 10 = 1

      After shrinking the brick will be 10 - 1 = 9 cm
```

### 2.2. Stock Board

_Brick frog_

It is used to make frog in the brick. 

  **Frog**:
  * It is made in the top surface of the brick.
  * Bonding becomes good because of the frog.
  * Due to the frog capacity to bear shear force of the wall increases.
  * Trademan names are embeded in reverse/inverse direction 
  * **Size of frog 10 x 4 x ( 1 or 2) cm**

### 2.3. Strike
It is used to remove the extra soil from the top of the brick.

### 2.4 Pallet Board

It is used to dry bricks after moulding and transportation 
size of pallete: **40" x 48"**
