# Brick

***A brick is a type of construction material used to build walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Properly, the term brick denotes a unit primarily composed of clay, but is now also used informally to denote units made of other materials or other chemically cured construction blocks. Bricks can be joined using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking. Bricks are usually produced at brickworks in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region, and are produced in bulk quantities*** [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Brick)


## Size of brick 
* **Standard Size**: 19x9x9 cm.
* **Modular size**: ***same as standard size*** 19x9x9 cm.
* **Nominal size**: (***It is the size of brick with mortor***) 20x10x10 cm.
* **Traditional/ Conventinal size of brick**: 9x4.5x3 inches.

## Weight of brick. 
* Weight of brick: **3 kg to 3.5 kg**

## Ingredients of brick work 
***It the ingredients of soil by which brick is made. The trick to remmember it is `SALIMA`***
* **Silica** -> 50% to 60%.
* **Alumina** -> 20% to 30%.
* **Lime** -> 4% to 5%.
* **Iron Oxide** -> 5% to 6%.
* **Magnesia** -> 1%.
* **Alkalies** -> 1%

<u><b>NOTE: The total amount of clay and silt should be less than 50%</b></u>

## Functions of ingredients of Brick earth 

### 1. Silica (50% to 60%)
    
<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2, commonly found in nature as quartz. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand. Silica is abundant as it comprises several minerals and synthetic products. All forms are white or colorless, although impure samples can be colored. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Silicon_dioxide">wiki</a>
</i></b>
</details>
<ul>
    <li>It provides <b>Strength</b> and <b>Durability</b> to the brick.</li>
    <li> It reduces the <b>shrinkage</b> of the brick. </li>
    <li>
      It keeps the <b>edges</b> of the brick <b>sharp</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      It <b>stops warping</b>
    </li>
</ul>
<b>
  <u>
    Excessive amount of silica _(over 50 to 60%)_ will make brick brittle and weak, due to the loss of cohession (cohession is the property of of some elemenet to form a bond)
  </u>
</b>

### 2. Alumina (20% to 30%) 
<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
Aluminium oxide (or aluminium(III) oxide) is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al2O3. It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides, and specifically identified as aluminium oxide. It is commonly called alumina and may also be called aloxide, aloxite, or alundum in various forms and applications. It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase α-Al2O3 as the mineral corundum, varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire. Al2O3 is used to produce aluminium metal, as an abrasive owing to its hardness, and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aluminium_oxide">wiki</a>
</i></b>
</details>
<ul>
    <li>
      It provides <b>plasticity</b> to the brick.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is the main component of the brick. 
    </li>
</ul>
<b>
<u>
Excessive amount of Alumina _(over 20% to 30%)_ : The edges of the brick won't be sharp in the edges and corners. And the shrinkage will increase due to which cracks will be generated in the brick
</u>
</b>

### 3. Lime (4% to 5%)

<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
Lime is an inorganic material composed primarily of calcium oxides and hydroxides. It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO. The word lime originates with its earliest use as building mortar and has the sense of sticking or adhering.<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lime_(material)">wiki</a>
</i></b>
</details>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The lime shouldn't be in **lump form**. It should be in **Powder form** always.
    </li>
    <li>
      It reduces **shrinkage** in the brick.
    </li>
    <li>
     It works as a **flux**.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <b>
    <u>
    Excessive amount of Lime _(over 4% t0 5%)_ : It can over burn the brick.
    </u>
  </b>

### 4. Iron oxide (5% to 6%)

<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. Several iron oxides are recognized. Often they are non-stoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.Electrochemically oxidized iron (rust)

Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes. They are used as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, and in thermite, and occur in hemoglobin. Iron oxides are inexpensive and durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the "earthy" end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range. When used as a food coloring,<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iron_oxide">wiki</a>

</details>
  <ul>
    <ul>
       It **provides** the **red colour** to the brick.
    </ul>
    <ii>
       It make brick **impermeable**.
    </ii>
    <ii>
      It gives **Hardness** to the brick.
    </ii>
  </ul>
    <b>
      <u>
      Excessive amount of Iron Oxide _(over 5% to 6%)_, It makes the brick blackish or dark blue
      </u>
    </b>

### 5. Magnesia (1%)

<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
Magnesium oxide (MgO), or magnesia, is a white hygroscopic solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium (see also oxide). It has an empirical formula of MgO and consists of a lattice of Mg2+ ions and O2− ions held together by ionic bonding. Magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water (MgO + H2O → Mg(OH)2), but it can be reversed by heating it to remove moisture.<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Magnesium_oxide">wiki</a>
</i></b>
</details>
  <ul>
    <ii>
       It gives **yellow colour** to the brick.
    </ii>
    <ii>
       It reduces **shrinkage** in the brick.
    </ii>
  </ul>
  <b>
    <u>
      Excessive amount of Magnesia _(over 1%)_, makes the brick yellwish and the decay of the brick will start
    </u>
  </b>

### 6. Alkalies (1%)
<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
<b><i>
In chemistry, an alkali (/ˈælkəlaɪ/; from Arabic: القلوي, romanized: al-qaly, lit. 'ashes of the saltwort') is a basic, ionic salt of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. An alkali can also be defined as a base that dissolves in water. A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7.0. The adjective alkaline, and less often, alkalescent, is commonly used in English as a synonym for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the Arrhenius definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alkali">wiki</a>

         It shouldn't be present. It causes <b>efflorosence</b>.

## Harmful substances in Brick earth. 
### 1. [Organic matter](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Organic_matter)
  * It includes things like _plants leaves and roots_ and while burning of brick the leave the gap.
  * It makes the moulding of the brick harder. 

### 2. [Lump lime](https://search.brave.com/search?q=lump+lime&source=desktop&summary=1&summary_og=046128ca81c523ada233ce)
 * When burning of the brick it will form **CaO (Calicium oxide)**. CaO reacts with **water (H2O)** and it volume increases 2 to 2.5 times which can cause **cracks** in the brick. 

### 3. [Alkalies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alkali)
 * The cause **efflorosence** in the brick.

### 4. Pebbles and gravels*
 * Due to them proper mixing and moulding won't happen.

### 5. [Carbonaceous material](https://search.brave.com/search?q=carboneceous+material&source=web&summary=1&summary_og=696c047b5a5ba2ad2a2a95)
  * It cause **black core defect** in the brick.

### 6. [Sulphur](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sulfur)
  * In the presences of sulphur extra **spongy swallen mass** will collect on the surface of the brick.
